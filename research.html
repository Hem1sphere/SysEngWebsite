                    <h5 style="color:#0b9caf"><strong>Python VS JavaScript</strong></h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>At the beginning stage, we looked into both Python and JavaScript as the main programming language used in NHS PlayGround web app project.</p>
                    <p>With regard to JavaScript, the Node.js is quite powerful and can provide services from huge number of free tools. One word â€“ npm, a default Node.js package manager, it also serves as a marketplace for open source JavaScript tools,
                        which plays an important role in the advance of this technology. In addition, Node.js has generally better efficiency and overall developer productivity since With the same language on both sides, you can reuse code on front-end
                        and back-end by wrapping it into modules and creating a new level of abstraction.[1]</p>
                    <p>As for Python, there is a python-based free and open-source web framework named Django allowing you to quickly and efficiently create a quality Web application. Django is a full stack web development framework can be used to develop
                        full fledged websites in Python. It encourages rapid development and advocates pragmatic and clean code [2]. In this project, we have to using lots of python-based tools and server (e.g. Jupyter). It could be easier for us to use
                        Python in this project without many "pipeline" files.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h5 style="color:#0b9caf"><strong>Choice of Database</strong></h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>As for the database, the options explored were MySQL, SQLite and Microsoft Server SQL. SQLite is
                        an embedded database and has less features compared to MySQL such as support for concurrency and does
                        not scale to huge amounts of data while Microsoft Server SQL is similar to MySQL in terms of richness of the features
                        provided. Microsoft SQL Server is the engine used in the Azure SQL Database which is a database-as-service(DBaaS)
                        provided by Azure. We chose Azure SQL Database due to its ease of integration with the web app which is also hosted
                        on Azure as well and the provision of additional services on top of just the engine.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h5 style="color:#0b9caf"><strong>Embedded Coding Environment</strong></h5>
                     <br>

                    <h6 style="color:#19b0ec"><strong>AWS SageMaker VS Azure Machine Learning</strong></h6>
                     <br>
                    <p>For the embedded coding environment, we first looked into using AWS SageMaker and Azure Machine Learning Studio. </p>

                    <p>The advantages of using AWS SageMaker [3] are: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A fully-managed platform that enables developers and data scientists to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning models at any scale.</li>
                        <li>Removes all the barriers that typically slow down developers who want to use machine learning.</li>
                        <li>Makes it easy to build ML models and get them ready for training by providing everything you need to quickly connect to your training data, and to select and optimize the best algorithm and framework for your application</li>
                        <li>For training, users can begin training their model with a single click in the Amazon SageMaker console.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <b>However, AWS SageMaker cannot be embedded into the web app.</b>
                    </p>

                    <p>The benefits Azure Machine Learning Studio [4] provide are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Build and train machine-learning models faster, and easily deploy to the cloud or the edge with Azure Machine Learning service.</li>
                        <li>Use the latest open source technologies such as TensorFlow, PyTorch or Jupyter.</li>
                        <li>Experiment locally and then quickly scale up or out with large GPU-enabled clusters in the cloud.</li>
                        <li>Track your experiments, manage models and easily deploy with integrated CI/CD tooling.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <b>However, Azure Machine Learning Studio is not available in UK region.</b>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h6 style="color:#19b0ec"><strong>Comparisons between different Jupyter Projects</strong></h6>

                   <br>
                    <p>Jupyter Notebook:</p>
                    <p>Then, we thought of embedding the Jupyter notebook directly on the web app. The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and
                        narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more [5]. 
                        The notebook extends the console-based approach to interactive computing in a qualitatively new direction, providing a web-based application suitable for capturing the whole computation process: developing, documenting, and executing code, as well as communicating the results. 
                        The Jupyter notebook combines two components:
                        A web application: a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents which combine explanatory text, mathematics, computations and their rich media output.
                        Notebook documents: a representation of all content visible in the web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects [5].
                        However, Jupyter notebooks do not support multiple users and can hardly be deployed on a remote server.</p>

                    <p>JupyterLab:</p>
                    <p>JupyterLab is a web-based user interface for Project Jupyter. JupyterLab enables people to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, 
                    and extensible manner. You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters. Documents and activities integrate with each other, enabling new workflows for interactive computing, for example:
                    Code Consoles provide transient scratchpads for running code interactively, with full support for rich output. A code console can be linked to a notebook kernel as a computation log from the notebook, and
                    Kernel-backed documents enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel [6].</p>
                
                    <p>JupyterHub:</p>
                    <p>Based on our research, JupyterHub is a good choice for this project. JupyterHub, a multi-user Hub, spawns, manages, and proxies multiple instances of the single-user Jupyter notebook server. JupyterHub can be used to serve notebooks
                        to a class of students, a corporate data science group, or a scientific research group [7]. JupyterHub brings the power of notebooks to groups of users. It gives users access to computational environments and resources without
                        burdening the users with installation and maintenance tasks. Users - including students, researchers, and data scientists - can get their work done in their own workspaces on shared resources which can be managed efficiently by
                        system administrators [7].</p>
                    
                    <p>JupyterHub allows users to interact with a computing environment through a web page. As most devices have access to a web browser, JupyterHub makes it is easy to provide and standardize the computing environment of a group of people
                        (e.g. for a class of students or an analytics team).The Kubernetes can help us set up our own JupyterHub on a cloud and leverage the clouds scalable nature to support large groups of users.</p>

                    <p>JupyterHub is featured with lots of functions. JupyterHub has pluggable authentication,so that we can manage users and authentication with PAM, OAuth or integrate withr other directory service system.
                    It can work with centralized deployment, Jupyter Notebook to thousands of users is in the organization on centralized infrastructure on- or off-site.
                    What's more, it is container friendly which means we can yse Docker and Kubernetes to scale the deployment, isolate user processes, and simplify software installation [7].</p>
                    
                    <br>

                    <h6 style="color:#19b0ec"><strong>JupyterHub with Kubernetes</strong></h6>

                    <br>
                    <p>Kubernetes: </p>
                    <p>Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery [8].
                    Kubernetes provides service discovery and load balancing. Then there is no need for developers to modify the application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. 
                    Kubernetes gives containers their own IP addresses for a set of containers, and can load-balance across them.
                    </p>

                    <p>Container: </p>
                    <p>The Old Way to deploy applications was to install the applications on a host using the operating-system package manager. 
                    This had the disadvantage of entangling the applicationsâ€™ executables, configuration, libraries, and lifecycles with each other and with the host OS. 
                    One could build immutable virtual-machine images in order to achieve predictable rollouts and rollbacks, but VMs are heavyweight and non-portable [8].
                    </p>
                    <p>The New Way is to deploy containers based on operating-system-level virtualization rather than hardware virtualization. These containers are isolated from each other and from the host: 
                    they have their own filesystems, they canâ€™t see each othersâ€™ processes, and their computational resource usage can be bounded. 
                    They are easier to build than VMs, and because they are decoupled from the underlying infrastructure and from the host filesystem, they are portable across clouds and OS distributions [8].
                    </p>

                    <p>Because containers are small and fast, one application can be packed in each container image. This one-to-one application-to-image relationship unlocks the full benefits of containers.
                    With containers, immutable container images can be created at build/release time rather than deployment time, since each application doesnâ€™t need to be composed with the rest of the application stack, nor married to the production infrastructure environment [8]. 
                    Generating container images at build/release time enables a consistent environment to be carried from development into production. Similarly, containers are vastly more transparent than VMs, which facilitates monitoring and management. 
                    This is especially true when the containersâ€™ process lifecycles are managed by the infrastructure rather than hidden by a process supervisor inside the container. 
                    Finally, with a single application per container, managing the containers becomes tantamount to managing deployment of the application [8].
                    Hence, we decided to use container to deploy the JupyterHub with Kubernetes.</p>
