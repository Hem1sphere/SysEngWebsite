                    <p>To ensure our Django application is functioning as intended, we wrote unit and integration tests
                        for the application as part of the development process. The unit and integration tests were largely automated using our development tools.</p>
                    <p>The web application is also intended to work across different browsers because we do not expect
                        homogenity in the browsers used by our users. To verify compatibility behaviour, we carried out compatibility testing.</p>
                    <p>Another major aspect of testing done was responsive design testing to establish our application's ability  to function
                        on different screen resolutions. The method of execution and results of our tests are described detailedly in the sections below.</p>

                    <hr class="featurette-divider">
                    <p>Our tests of the application itself follows the best practices as recommended by Django and makes
                        extensive use of the Django test suite. For each sub-application (the different Django applications e.g. users, challenges etc),
                        tests were organised neatly in their own directory and were written for views, models and forms where applicable. </p>
                    <p>The tests for views include whether the correct template was used,
                        whether the URL routing is correctly set up and HTTP requests such as post requests are correctly processed etc.
                        In the tests for models, we test for correct behavior of object creation and retrieval as desired. For
                        forms, form validation is tested.</p>
                    <p>The source code for the tests can be viewed in the "tests" directory in each sub-application. In the diagram below,
                        we show an example of the test code written which in this case is for the challenge view.</p>

                        phones and observed the results as shown below. Our application is generally responsive and is rendered

                    <hr class="featurette-divider">
                    <p>To enable automated testing, we made use of the auto-testing feature found on PyCharm. It works by
                        running the selected test classes whenever changes to the code are made.</p>
                    <p>When making changes to a certain part of the application, we select the relevant test code to be ran
                        under the auto-testing feature. This ensured a safe workflow - any modifications to the codebase
                        will not break the application unnoticed.</p>

                    <hr class="featurette-divider">
                    <p>We carried out user acceptance testing by coming up with a list of tasks a user is expected
                        to accomplish with ease if our site is well-designed and getting their feedback upon completion
                        of those tasks. We split our list of tasks into developers and clinicians as their usage of the
                        application will vary widely and having separate tasks for each role will be more accurate. </p>
                    <p>As we could not get access to an actual clinician due to time constraints and the client being unavailable
                        in the final phase of the project, we got another developer to mock as a clinician. The list of
                        tasks given to developers and clinicians can be found in Figure 1 and Figure 2 respectively
                        while their feedback is shown in Figure 3.</p>
