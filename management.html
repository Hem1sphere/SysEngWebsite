                    <h4>Legal Issues</h4>
                    <hr class="featurette-divider">
                    <p class="lead">The legal issues concering this project will be discussed in three areas: Liability,
                        Intellectual Property (IP), and Privacy.</p>
                    <h5 style="color:#0b9caf"><strong>Liability</strong></h5>
                    <p>The terms and conditions of software delivery specifies the deliverables expected and the dates
                        by which they are to be delivered. If the group is unable to complete the task and deliver on time
                        for whatever reasons, the group will be breaching the contract and hence liable for it.</p>
                    <p>The web application is collecting the data of users in the form of their emails. The group thus
                        have a duty of care in handling and processing the data in a responsible manner and only for its
                        specified purposes. In the event of a breach of that duty, the group is then potentially liable
                        under negligence and tort. Simultaneously, it is a liability under General Data Protection
                        Regulation (GDPR). This further includes insufficient security measure which results in the
                        application being hacked which causes the personal data of the data subjects to be leaked.</p>
                    <p>The project is also potentially liable under the Copyright Act. This is because the premise of our
                        project is based off Kaggle – an existing platform for data scientists and machine learners to solve
                        challenges – and the need for National Health Service (NHS) to have its own Kaggle. The user
                        interface and site structure were designed to be similar to that of Kaggle for reasons relating
                        to design principles to ensure the site is highly navigable. Also, the fundamental purpose of the
                        application is also identical to that of Kaggle which serves as a cause of copyright infringement.</p>
                    <p>Another potential liability falls under the Disability Discrimination Act. The Act states that
                        disabled people should have equal access to products and services. As our application is a web
                        application, it can be evaluated using the W3C web content accessibility guidelines. Some examples
                        of the guidelines include providing a text equivalent for every non-text element and ensuring
                        information can be conveyed without colour. If our web application does not adhere sufficiently
                        to the guidelines, it will violate the act and hence make the team liable.  </p>
                    <h5 style="color:#0b9caf"><strong>IP</strong></h5>
                    <p>The main tool used to develop the web application is the Django web framework. As Django is a free
                        and open-source tool, there are no issues with using it in the project. Also, JupyterHub is another
                        major tool used to provide a coding environment onsite. It is also free and open-source.</p>
                    <p>There are two main types of free software licenses – permissive software licenses like Berkeley
                        Software Distribution (BSD) and copyleft licenses like GNU General Public License (GPL). The main
                        difference between the two lies in that the former allows unrestricted distribution of modified
                        source code while the latter requires derivative work to be released under the same license. For
                        our application, a copyleft license is preferred over the permissive one as that will benefit the
                        long-term development of the project more when other developers work on it and are legally required
                        to release improved versions of the application. More specifically, the Affero General Public
                        License (AGPLv3) will be adopted for the source code for its tighter restrictions than GPL. The
                        final project will be made available under a GitHub repository with its license explicitly mentioned.</p>
                    <p>In addition, as per requested by the client, it is agreed that the rights to the web application
                        will be assigned to and managed by Apperta Foundation – a clinician-led and non-profit company
                        supported by NHS. This is due to the interim nature of the project team and the team’s inability
                        to further work on the project and to manage the license after product delivery to the client.
                        The Apperta Foundation avoids liabilities by stating in its disclaimer that the use of the application
                        is at the user’s own risk and it does not accept any responsibility for any loss or damage as a
                        result of using the software.</p>
                    <h5 style="color:#0b9caf"><strong>Privacy</strong></h5>
                    <p>The web application serves as a platform for NHS clinicians to post their AI challenges and its
                        accompanying data which could potentially be patient data. The onus is on the clinicians to be
                        responsible in the type of the data posted and act in accordance to GDPR. This could include
                        anonymising the data so the data is no longer considered personal data or pseudonymising the data
                        as part of data protection. </p>
                    <p>During the process of account creation on the site, the only personal data collected about the user
                        will be their email address. Adhering to the data protection principles, the application would
                        explain and state unambiguously to the data subjects i.e. the users on why their email addresses
                        are required (for mutual contact if the developer has questions or the clinician chooses the
                        developer’s solution etc) and kept strictly to those purposes. This complies with Article 5 of GDPR
                        which states that personal data collected is limited to what is necessary and nothing more will be
                        collected other than the required email addresses. Also, the application will provide users with
                        the ability to revoke the consent of having their data collected and processed – the application
                        will allow for the deletion of the account and the relevant user data.</p>
                    <p>It is also part of GDPR to ensure the data is secure. The application aims to maximise security
                        by following existing best practices such as those recommended by Django for production. Django
                        provides a basic layer of security where passwords are automatically encrypted. In addition, the
                        web application is hosted on and deployed to a reliable cloud service provider (Microsoft Azure
                        in our case) which itself is compliant to GDPR with its own security measures. This greatly minimises
                        the risk of a hacking incident and a consequent data leak.</p>

                        to access the Django admin page with administrative permissions, the username is <em>admin</em>

                    </p>

                    <p>A developer and clinician account can be created via registration on the site although a clincian
                        account has to be approved on the admin page. Hence, for convenience, a developer account can be accessed
                        using username <em>test_developer</em> and password <em>developer123</em> while the provided clinician
                        account has username <em>test_clinician</em> and password <em>clinician123</em>.
